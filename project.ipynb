    "This project aims to predict the price of Airbnb listings in Hawaii, which is a regression problem. I will consider various factors that make up an Airbnb listing, such as location, number of bedrooms, type of property, and reviews, in order to determine the key factors that play into the pricing of Airbnb's in Hawaii."

    "## Project Goal\n",
    "My family is from Hawaii, and I love to visit the islands as much as I can. I hope to create a tool that can help people determine fair pricing of lodging in Hawaii. I will achieve this goal by discovering the most important factors that determine Airbnb pricing, and ultimately create a model that can predict or suggest pricing for Airbnb hosts and guests. Hosts can use the model to price their listings competitively, while guests can ensure they are getting a fair deal."

    "We will be using the Inside Airbnb: Hawaii dataset, available on Inside Airbnb. This dataset is updated regularly and provides comprehensive information about Airbnb listings in various cities around the world. The Hawaii dataset specifically includes details about listings across the Hawaiian islands. The dataset consists of approximately 28,000 Airbnb listings in Hawaii, from June 9th, 2022 to September 12th, 2022. The attributes of the dataset consist of listing's ID, name, host ID, host name, island, neighbourhood, latitude, longitude, room type, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, calculated host listings count, and availability in the year. The exact size of the table for this dataset is 28580 x 18. Below is the first entry in the dataset to serve as a sample for the dataset attributes."
